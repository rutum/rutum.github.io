# About

My name is Rutu Mulkar and I am a Principal Applied Scientist at Amazon, working on problems related to NLP, ML and Large Language Models. My background is largely in startup world, and I have founded 2 companies in the NLP space - one of which had a successful exit, and the other was in GenAI that received grant funding from Sam Altman though YC. I have a Ph.D. in Natural Language Processing, during which I contributed to IBM Watson that defeated humans at Jeopardy!
