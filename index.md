# About

My name is Rutu Mulkar and I am a Sr. Manager in Applied Science at Amazon. Previously, I was the Founder of Hunchera and the founder of Ticary Solutions (acquired in the summer of 2019). I have a Ph.D. in Natural Language Processing, during which I contributed to IBM Watson that defeated humans at Jeopardy! (<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ibm-announces-eight-universities-contributing-to-the-watson-computing-systems-development-115892914.html">news story</a>).

I write about <a href="http://rutumulkar.com/ml-notes">ML/NLP</a> and <a href="https://rutumulkar.com/bookproject">book summaries</a>. I love languages - both Natural Languages and Programming languages. I speak English, Hindi and Gujarati fluently and bits of Korean and Spanish.

I started out as a Computer Engineer and later I got my Masters and Doctorate in Computer Science from <a href="usc.edu">University of Southern California (USC)</a>.  I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the San Diego Supercomputer Center, at <a href="ucsd.edu">University of California, San Diego (UCSD)</a>.
