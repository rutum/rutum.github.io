<p>I am the Founder of Hunchera. Previously I was the founder <a href="http://www.ticary.com">Ticary Solutions</a> (a Natural Language Processing solutions provider) that I sold to Sigmoidal.io</p>

<p> I have a Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence from before AI was considered a hot topic. I was also a contributor to IBM Watson that defeated humans at Jeopardy!</p>

<p>I love languages - both Natural Languages and Programming languages. I speak English, Hindi and Gujarati fluently and bits of Korean and Spanish.</p>

<p>I started out as a Computer Engineer and later I got my Masters and Doctorate in Computer Science from <a href="usc.edu">University of Southern California (USC)</a>.  I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the San Diego Supercomputer Center, at <a href="ucsd.edu">University of California, San Diego (UCSD)</a> before I switched over from working in academic to the corporate world.
