This book is one of the first books to read as an entrepreneur. [Ben Horowitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Horowitz) candidly talks about the struggles, and hard things about starting, running and growing companies. Here is a [Techcrunch article](https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/03/the-hard-thing-about-hard-things-ben-horowitzs-honest-and-real-take-on-entrepreneurship/) reviewing this book.

### The beginning

A bully told Ben to ask another kid for his wagon, and if the other kid refuses, to spit in his face and call him profanity. Ben reluctantly went to the other kid and politely asked to play with his wagon, and the other kid obliged. This is how Ben met his best friend - by doing something uncomfortable. It taught him not to judge things by their surfaces, and that there are no shortcuts to anything. 

Some tidbits of learning: 
- The most important rule of raising money privately: Look for a market of one. You only need one investor to say yes, so it is better to ignore the other thirty who say "no"
- The best things about startups is that you only ever experience two emotions - euphoria and terror, and the lack of sleep enhances them both. 
- You need 2 kinds of friends in your life - the one you can call when things are great and who can be happy for you, and one you can call when things are going bad and who is your lifeline in that bad time. 
- Have mentors who have gone though some horrible and devastating circumstances so that they can advice you how to avoid them
- Startup CEOs should not play the odds. WHen you are building a company, you must believe that there is an answer and you cannot pay attention to your odds of finding it. 

### When things fall apart

The secret to being a successful CEO is the ability to focus and make the best move when there are no good moves. 

Struggle in your company is not failure - but it often causes failure - if you are not strong enough to endure it. 

How to deal with struggle: 
- Divide and conquer - seek help, don't put it all on your own shoulders
- Don't underestimate the complexity - this is chess not checkers. 
- Play long enough and you might get lucky
- Do not take it personally



### Take care of the people, the products and the profits - in that order

### Concerning the growing concern

### How to lead even when you don't know where you are going

### First rule of entrepreneurship - there are no rules
