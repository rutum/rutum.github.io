### Goals vs. Systems
When you have a system you constantly follow that system without worrying about reaching a "destination". Each day you follow your system is a successful day. 

On the other hand, if you have a goal, each day that you are not at your goal you feel that yearning to be at your goal. Each day is another day that you have not achieved that goal. Each day is a failure to reach the goal. 

For example, in the world of dieting, eating right is a system, but losing 10 pounds is a goal. 

If you do something everyday, it is a system. If you're waiting to achieve it some day in the future, it is a goal. Most people who are goal oriented stay in a permanent cycle of pre-success failure. 

Most people who succeed follow systems not goals. 

Another disadvantage of a goal is that once you achieve it, you set a next goal and continue to feel like you have failed till you achieve the goal - thereby living in a continued cycle of presuccess failure. 

### Deciding vs. Wanting
Everything has a price. If you want success, figure out the price and then pay it. Once you decide on what you want, you are acknowledging the price associated with it and are willing to pay it. 

Successful people dont wish for success. They decide to pursue it. 

### Be Selfish
