<a href="https://amzn.to/2IynY1A">Braving the Wilderness, A quest for True Belonging and the Courage to Stand Alone</a> - by Brene Brown

### Everywhere and Nowhere

In this chapter Dr. Brown talks about the famous quote by Dr. Maya Angelou 

> You are only free when you realize you belong no place - you belong every place - no place at all. The price is high. The reward is great. 

As humans we find great comfort in belonging to something - a team, a group, a place that gives comfort of community. Brene Brown talks about her childhood - growing up in New Orleans, Texas, Washington DC and the impact that it had in her life to belong somewhere. She talks about how she didn't get into her school drill team - something she desperately wanted, to enable her to belong somewhere and have an enviable social life. She talks about the desire to belong in our families, and with our spouses. 

The biggest desire that is often unmet is our need to belong to ourselves - giving ourselves the permission to be us - and following our path and our truth - unadulterated by judgment from ourselves and from others. 

We belong everywhere - and yet we don't belong completely at any one place. But the realization that we belong to ourselves is huge - it is a steep uphill realization, but the rewards are incredible. 

### The Quest for True Belonging

We want to belong - truly and completely in a way that is authentic and unconditional. 

Dr. Brown studied that we (as humans) want to belong to a larger community and experience being part of something - but without giving up our own self and our own authenticity. It is hard for us to chose between being loyal to ourselves and being loyal to a group - which creates some pressure to "conform" and to "fit in".

The definition of trusting can be captured by the acronym BRAVING

- B - Boundaries - Respect boundaries, and if unclear ask!
- R - Reliability - Say what you do and do what you say
- A - Accountability - Own your mistakes and apologize and make amends
- V - Vault - Don't share information that is not yours to share
- I - Integrity - Chose the right path, instead of the easy path
- N - Non-judgment - Ask for what you need, and don't judge others for what they need
- G - Generosity - Be generous with your intentions, words and actions of others

Applying the concept of BRAVING to yourself - 
- do you trust yourself? 
- do you respect your own boundaries?
- are you reliable with yourself?
- are you accountable with yourself?
- do you respect your vault/your information? 
- do you act with integrity?
- do you ask for what you need?
- are you generous towards yourself? 

>True belonging is the spiritual practice of believing in and belonging to yourself so deeply that you can share your most authentic self with the world and find sacredness in both - being a part of something and standing alone in the wilderness. True belonging doesn't require you to CHANGE who you are; it requires you to BE who you are. 

### High Lonesome: A Spiritual Crisis

"High Lonesome" - that holler that is in between a spirited yippee and a painful wail - something that is thick with misery and redemption. 

We have geographically, politically and spiritually sorted ourselves into like-minded groups in which we grow more extreme in our thinking, and consume only the facts that support our beliefs - making it even more easier to ignore evidence that our positions are wrong. So we live in a giant feedback loop - hearing our own thoughts about what is right and wrong being bounced back to us in the TV shows that we watch, books we read etc. 

We sort ourselves and also others in an unintentional and reflexive manner - but it creates distances and divisiveness. We are all ideologically diverse. However selecting like-minded friends and neighbors and separating ourselves from people whom we think of as different has not delivered that deep sense of belonging that we are hardwired to crave. 

Loneliness is - "perceived social isolation".  We experience it when we feel disconnected. "Loneliness" and "being alone" are very different things. Being alone is finding therapy in solace, being lonely is feeling disconnected from your surroundings. 

To combat loneliness we must first learn to identify it, and then treat it like a warning sign - signaling a need for socialization - like the warning sign we get from our body when we are hungry (and need food), or thirsty (and need water). 

High lonesome can be a beautiful and powerful place if we can own our pain and share it, instead of inflicting pain on others - and if we can find a way to FEEL the hurt (and do something about it) rather than SPREAD the hurt. 

### People are Hard to Hate Close Up: MOVE IN!

We might hate or dislike large groups of people of a certain category, but we can love individuals belonging to those categories. 

e.g. "Democrats are such losers" - yes - except your coworker who helped watch your kids when you were taking care of your sick family member. 
e.g. "Republicans are selfish assholes" - yes - except your son-in-law who is so kind and warm. 

We don't like certain ideologies - which bring us pain - but to deny our own pain, or denying others pain - neither of those options really work. We need to be able to find a way to get on the same page. 

Anger needs to be transformed into something life-giving - like courage, love, change, compassion and justice. 

Courage is forged in pain - but not in all pain. Pain that is denied or ignored becomes fear or hate. Anger that is never transformed becomes resentment and bitterness. 

Some thoughts on conflict resolution: 

- Q: Sometimes we decide to "agree to disagree". Does that work?
- A: "Agree to disagree" without exploring the full nature of the disagreement leads to avoidance and making assumptions. The goal should be increased mutual understanding. 

- Q: If we decide to continue working on a disagreement, how do we push through the vulnerability and stay civil?
- A: Find out what the conversation is "really about", what is the "common goal". Understand each others motives and interests more closely

- Q: "Putting people on the stand" - you said "X" last week but you are saying "Y" now, which ones is it?
- A: It never helps to go down that route. Focus on "where are we now"? "What are we trying to accomplish for the future"? "What do we want our relationship to be going forward"? Shift the focus on getting on the same page. 

- Q: "Conflict transformation" instead of "conflict resolution". Why?
- A: The latter dissipates the tension to go back to previous states of affairs, the former transforms the conflict to a higher level of understanding and creating something new from the situation. 

- Q: I am preparing arguments in my head when other people are talking. But I don't like it when others do it to me. What is the alternative?
- A: One of the more courageous things to do is to say - "tell me more". Just when you want to end the conversation, turn away etc - use it as an opportunity to fully understand the other persons perspective even better. Listen to them - really listen. We have to listen the same way we want to be understood.
