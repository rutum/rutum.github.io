I have been studying the trends in raising money in USA, and the numbers are staggering! In the past 10 years the amount of money raised has doubled and is projected to cross 5 Trillion in 2019. (Check out the accompanying plot).

I will have more fine grained analysis of this work in the coming weeks, some of which include: 
- amount raised by a VC funds vs founders
- Amount raised by companies with at least one female founder
- most concentrated geolocations where funding is raised etc.

If you have other questions about this work that would be interesting to this group, please comment below and I will add it to the list of analysis

A couple of days ago I shared a post about the amount of money that has been raised for the past 10 years. Today I wanted to share the category of companies that have raised money. In the attached image look at the bars in black - these are pooled investment funds - they are institutions like PSL, YCombinator, and others who have raised funds to support startups like ours. It also includes hedge funds. In green you see the next highest category - banking and financial. Another category is navy (dark blue) which is for ... wait for it... Investment Banking! Interesting huh? Most funds are raised for investment to generate more funds.

Those tiny slivers of colors that you see at the top of each bar? Yeah... those are companies like you and me who raise money! It kind of takes me back to those solar system and universe pictures that show us how insignificant we are in the grand scheme of things. More analysis coming soon. As always - any questions are welcome!
