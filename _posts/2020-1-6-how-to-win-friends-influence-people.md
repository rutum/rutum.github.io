### Fundamental Techniques in Handling People

**1. Don't criticize, condemn, or complain:**

Criticism is futile and it makes the opposite person on the defensive and make them strive to justify themselves. Any fool can criticize, condemn and complain- and most fools do. But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving. 

**2. Give honest and sincere appreciation:**

There is only one way to get anyone to do anything - by making them want to do it. There is no other way. 
Dr. John Dewey said that the deepest urge in human nature is "the desire to be important". This desire to be important makes poverty-stricken grocery clerk to study law books (Lincoln), or for Dickens to be inspired to write his immortal novels. 

Charles Schwab was the first person in America to be paid a million dollars a year - because of his ability to deal with people. Schwab considered his greatest asset to be his ability to arouse enthusiasm among his people. The way he did it was with appreciation and encouragement. 

All humans need a nourishing dose of self esteem. And providing others this nourishment of and nurturing in the form of kind words of appreciation is greatly accepted and appreciated. 

Honest appreciation is not to be confused with flattery. Flattery is shallow, selfish and insincere. 

True appreciation is honest, and is sincere, without expecting anything in return but a smile from the recipient and to make someones day better. 

People crave the feeling of importance. Make someone feel important and they will think well of you. Diminish someone’s importance and they will resent you.

**3. Arouse in the other person an eager want**

Appeal to the other person’s interests. Virtually all people care more about what they want than what you want. You wouldn’t go fishing with cheesecake as a lure, since fish don’t like cheesecake. Go fishing with worms.

Keep asking yourself - "what is it that this person wants?"
Everyone has something they can teach you, and you benefit by figuring out what that is. This belief leads to a genuine interest and appreciation for other people.

Angry people are often angry because they feel unheard. Once you sympathize with them, they will soften their anger substantially.

If there is one secret to success, it lies in the ability to get the other persons point of view and see things from that person's angle as well as your own. 

The world is so full of people who are grabbing and self-seeking, that an unselfish individual who is willing to help others just to be helpful has a huge advantage and no competition. 

### Six Ways to Make People Like You

**1. Become genuinely interested in other people**

It is interesting to see that the dog is the only animal that does not "work" - unlike hen (lays eggs), cow (gives milk), canary (sings). Dogs make a living nothing but love. 

You can make more friends in 2 months by being interested in other people that you can in 2 years by trying to get other people interested in you. 

Everyone loves to be listened to and be appreciated. When we start with the recipient and their needs and wants, there is a much bigger and better chance for them to be amiable and warm and kind to you. 

**2. Smile**

Smiling makes a good first impression. If you don't feel like smiling, force yourself to smile (the action of smiling brings out the feeling of happiness and makes one want to smile more.)

Everyone in the world is looking for happiness, and the sure way to find it is by looking inwards and finding that in your heart. 

**3. A person loves their name.**

A person’s name is the most important word in any language to them. Use it often and respect it. 
Remember a name and call it easily, and you have paid an effective compliment to the recipient (that their name is worth remembering), forget it or misspell it and you have placed yourself at a sharp disadvantage. 

Andrew Carnegie remembered and honored many of his workers name, because of which there was never a strike or an issue under his leadership. All the employees felt loved and heard. 

**4. Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves**

When people are heard, it helps dissolve anger and helps them feel heard. Many a times just listening to a disgruntled customer helps deescalate the situation. 

Being a good listener is also a good way of becoming a good conversationalist. The more you listen to someone, the more they feel heard and important, and the more they enjoy your company. 

**5. Talk in terms of the other person's interests**

If your recipient is interested in books, starting a conversation with that interest is a great ice-breaker, and establishes a wonderful common ground to setup a communication pattern/style. 

**6. Make the other person feel important - and do it sincerely **

Doing this will make people like you instantaneously. Everyone has admirable qualities, and finding those and highlighting them - without having an agenda to sell to them - but only focusing on making them happy - will bring you a long way in building a personal connection with them. 
This approach could be used with someone you have just met, or others who you have known for years. 

Emerson said - "Every man that I meet is mu superior in some way. In that, I learn of him." Finding that superior quality and highlighting it with honestly is a wonderful quality that makes people like you instantaneously. 



### How to Win People to Your Way of Thinking
**1. The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it.**

If you argue and rankle and contradict, you may achieve a victory sometimes, but it will be an empty victory because you will never get your opponent's good will. 

Buddha said - Hatred is never ended by hatred but by love. And a misunderstanding is never ended by argument but by tact, diplomacy, conciliation and a sympathetic desire to see the other person's point of view. 

**2. Show respect to the other person's opinions. Never say, "You're wrong"**

Instead, approach with an open-minded view: "I may be wrong. I often am. And if I’m wrong, I want to change and be right. Let’s discuss the facts."
Praise the other person for a trait that will help resolve the argument - like their patience, open-mindedness, fairness, and receptivity to new facts.

Understand that the other person has a valid view of the situation. If you were born as them with their brain and undergoing their experiences, you would by definition feel the same way they do. Your job is to understand what led them to believe what they believe.
Express sympathy for their situation. "You have the absolute right to be upset. If I were in your shoes, I would be too."

To influence people to do things, praise and appreciation are more effective than orders.
Don’t start by criticizing or complaining. This makes them defensive and rationalize their actions. Instead, praising them lowers their defenses, and they’ll be more receptive to your feedback.

It is important to be diplomatic and look at all points of view. 

**3. If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically**

Humility and acceptance of being wrong is a huge virtue. It readily disarms the recipient and moves the conversation from "who is right", to "how do we fix this"? This strategy readily brings people together, and often brings the opposite person to your rescue by dismissing your mistakes as - "not that big", and "easy to fix".

**4. Begin in a friendly way**

**5. Get the other person saying "yes" immediately**

**6. Let the other person do a great deal of the talking**

Listen first. Give your opponents a chance to talk through. Do NOT interrupt as they’re speaking.

Ask people where they feel the problems are. Ask for their opinions on how best to proceed. Ask lots of questions instead of stating commands.

7. Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers
8. Try honestly to see things from the other person's perspective
9. Be sympathetic with the other person's ideas and desires
10. Appeal to the nobler motives
11. Dramatize your ideas
12. Throw down a challenge
