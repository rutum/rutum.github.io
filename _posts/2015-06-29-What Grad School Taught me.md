I have spent a large chunk of my life in grad school - getting my masters and Ph.D. Looking back, I feel like grad school helped me learn things that were not even on the syllabus:

Here are some life skills I learned in grad school - in no particular order

1. **Hobby:** It is important to have a hobby (or several) that help you disengage from work. It recharges you and helps you think creatively.

2. **Patience:** It is a virtue that doesnt come easy, but after a Ph.D. you have a lot of practice to be patient - an awesome quality to have in life!

3. **Family and Friends:** Surround yourself with people who you love to hang out with, and who love you and root for you - always!

4. **Take Risks:** If you dont take a chance on something, then you will never know if it will work out! Fairy tales do exist!

5. **Trust yourself:** your gut is right more often than not

6. **Have faith in the universe:** if you put good energies out here for specific things, you will unconsciously do everything to achieve your goals

7. **Dealing with Rock Bottom:** If things can't get any worse, then it is very likely for them to get better soon. Just hang in there.

8. **Motive yourself:** Always have a playlist of motivating songs, and a list of other activities (scuba diving anyone?) that motivate and drive you

I would love to hear about things that you have learned! Please feel free to share some of your thoughts in the comments below.
