<p>I am the Founder of HUnchera. Previously I was the founder <a href="http://www.ticary.com">Ticary Solutions (sold to Sigmoidal.io) </a>, which is a Data Science consulting firm for problems pertaining to Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. </p>

<p>I love languages - both Natural Languages and Programming languages. I speak English, Hindi and Gujarati fluently and bits of Korean and Spanish.</p>

<p>I started out as a Computer Engineer and later I got my Masters and Doctorate in Computer Science from <a href="usc.edu">University of Southern California (USC)</a>.  I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the San Diego Supercomputer Center, at <a href="ucsd.edu">University of California, San Diego (UCSD)</a> before I switched over from working in academic to the corporate world.
